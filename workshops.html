                            Graduation speeches are full of quotes like "choose a job you love and you'll never work
                            a day in your life" and "chase your passion and money will come." The people who say
                            these things are well intended, but let's be honest:

                            those are largely unhelpful phrases that mean very little when you're starting your
                            career.

                            Let's talk about career advice that is actionable and meaningful. What are some
                            productive approaches to shaping your career path in your teens and twenties? What skill
                            sets do employers care about most? What should you expect in a job interview? How do you
                            find your passion anyway?

                            All this and more, plus a gif on every slide.

                            So, you’ve developed an application. You’re happy with it, everything is working fine,
                            and you want to make sure the functionality you’ve developed will always work, no matter
                            what additional features are added in the future. Option A – manually testing. Every
                            time you add new code, take hours and hours to click around and make sure everything
                            still works as before. Option B – automated testing. Write some code that, at the push
                            of a button, can simulate a human interacting with your application to perform the same
                            tests as option A while you spend your time elsewhere. Which option would you choose?

                            If Option B, then this is the workshop for you. Using Cucumber, Protractor, and Chai, we
                            will enforce the process of Behavior Driven Development to help you optimize your

                            In this workshop, we’ll start with some data and a question we want to answer. We'll
                            then take a winding journey though how to answer that question using a variety of tools.
                            We'll start with the Linux shell and learn some ninja-level data munging tricks. Next
                            we'll step into the world of big data and explore our data using MapReduce, then Spark,
                            and finally Hive. When we're done, attendees will have a high level understanding of the
                            current most popular data analysis tools and some hands-on experience to back it up. All
                            work will be done on a Docker image that is preloaded with the data and the tools we
                            will use. All coding will be done in python. Attendees should come with a laptop with
                            Docker preinstalled and should ideally have the Docker image (templedf/phdata:latest)
                            pulled.
